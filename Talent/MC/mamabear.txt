Growing up in Southern California, Mamabear’s musical tastes were developed by spending nights in the roller rink, skating to Funk and Hip Hop as well as hearing her parents’ New Wave collection. In 2007 she purchased her first pair of Technics turntables; she quickly went from spinning in her bedroom to making her debut in San Francisco, and in 2009 became part of the acclaimed Sweaterfunk crew, the most devoted purveyors of spinning Boogie vinyl, which has hosted Dam-Funk, Steve Arrington, Leroy Burgess, Howard Johnson, and Onra, to name but a few. Beginning in 2010, DJ Mamabear spent 2 years living in the city where House music was born, Chicago, learning the art of extended blending and how to get lost in the 4-on-the-floor. p. Seeking a return to her roots, in 2015 she moved back to LA to where it all began. Frequently guesting on Dublab Radio, where she played her first live over the air mix in 2012, she earned her own show, The Honey Pot, where she showcases Boogie, Modern Soul and 2-Step every fourth Friday of the month from 8-10p PM PST at dublab.com
