Once a composer for daytime television, Ramm was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1992 for a song he wrote for Lauryn Hill's character on "As the World Turns." Euphoria was born about a year later, around the same time that industry-savvy musicians began using the Internet to promote their work. The Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) was Euphoria's first online home, and by 1996, the cyber venue had gained such momentum it became the subject of a Time magazine article, which noted Euphoria as one of IUMA's early loyalists. 

That same year, Ramm inked a deal with Six Degrees records, and his debut, Euphoria, was released in 1999. A second album, Beautiful My Child, was released in 2001, once again garnering attention from the film and television worlds. The single, "Little Gem," has been used on the hit TV series, "CSI," making its way onto the show's soundtrack, while Apple's Steve Jobs used the track "Sweet Rain" to launch MacWorld 2002.
